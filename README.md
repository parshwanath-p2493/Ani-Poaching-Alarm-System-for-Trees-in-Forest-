# Ani-Poaching-Alarm-System-for-Trees-in-Forest-
 Now-a-days, there are many incidents happening about smuggling of trees like 
Sandalwood which are very expensive and rare in nature. Smuggling of sandalwood has created 
many law and order problems in India. Also, Indiaâ€™s economy has been greatly effected through 
these incidents. The main objective of our project is to deploy a system which can be used to 
restrict these kind of incidents like smuggling of sandalwood trees. This project design uses 
three different sensors namely, Flame sensor (to detect forest fires), Tilt sensor (to detect the 
inclination of tree which is being cut), Sound sensor (for effective detection of illegal logging 
of trees i.e. the sounds generated while axing the tree is sensed). Data generated from these 
three sensors is continuously monitored by the forest officials with the help of  BLYNK server 
of  IoT (Blynk is an IoT platform that allows you to build your own apps to control certain 
devices over the internet). With respect to the sensors, their output devices are activated through 
relay switch. For all these sensors, a buzzer is activated when their conditions are violated.
